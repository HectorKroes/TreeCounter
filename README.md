# TreeCounter by Kroes
TreeCounter, a simple Android app made on MIT app inventor to count Ecosia searches and roughly analyse its impacts, free to use.

# How it looks

# Installation
1. Download the <a href="https://github.com/HectorKroes/TreeCounter/raw/master/TreeCounter_vFinal.apk">TreeCounter_vFinal.apk</a> file;
2. Access the folder in which you downloaded it and click the file to run it;
3. Press "Install" in the permission screen that will appear.

Note: You may need to enable downloads from others sources in your cellphone configuration before installing this software.

# Field explanation
- Started using: date formatted in M/D/Y in which you started using Ecosia. This data is used to calculate time-dependant variables.
- Country: the country where you live. If your country is not there, select "Other". This is used to automatically select your estimated carbon footprint.
- Carbon footprint: your estimated annual carbon footprint in kg. It should be selected automatically if you select one of the pre-programmed countries, but if you select others (either because your country isn't there or because you know your specific individual carbon footprint), you should fill this box with your annual carbon footprint in kg.
- Phone, Computer and Others: your Ecosia search counter in different devices.
- Total searches: sum of all your search counters.
- To the next: number of searches until you achieve your next tree.
- Searches/day: number of searches divided by the number of days since you started using Ecosia.
- Planted trees: approximate number of trees financed by your searches based on the information available on Ecosia's website (45 searches/tree estimate).
- Trees/day: number of trees planted divided by the number of days since you started using Ecosia.
- Yearly footprints: Amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the trees planted divided by your provided annual carbon footprint. That is, the estimate of how many of your annual footprints you compensated while using Ecosia.
- Relative footprints: yearly footprint divided by the number of years since you started using Ecosia. That is, the estimate of how many of your annual footprints you compensate each year you use Ecosia.

# How to make it work:
1. Select the date when you started using Ecosia;
2. Select the country which you are from or, if isn't there, select "Other" and write your carbon footprint. If you have
   your personal carbon footprint calculated, you might also want to select "Other" and write it in box right next to it;
3. Insert your number of searches in different devices;
4. Press "Calculate". This button doesn't just runs the calculations, it also saves the data you inserted in the app, so
   the next time you enter in it, they'll be automatically inputed.

# Considerations
This app is entirely local, it doesn't access the internet nor sends anything back to the developer. This was made as a personal project and something handy to me as I used to calculate this often, so it may not be the most user friendly app; If you find a bug or some other problem, please let me now, either by messaging me or creating an issue report here.

Thank you for your attention, hope you find it some use.
