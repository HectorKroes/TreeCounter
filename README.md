# Installation
You may need to enable downloads from others sources in your cellphone configuration before installing this software.

# How make it work:
1. Select the date when you started using Ecosia;
2. Select the country which you are from or, if isn't there, select "Other" and write your carbon footprint. If you have
   your personal carbon footprint calculated, you might also want to select "Other" and write it in box right next to it;
3. Insert your number of searches in different devices;
4. Press "Calculate". This button doesn't just runs the calculations, it also saves the data you inserted in the app, so
   the next time you enter in it, they'll be automatically inputed.
